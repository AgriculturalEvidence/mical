## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites Development Tool Installations

What things you need to install the software and how to install them. No need to install again if you already have installed these tools previously.

- This project uses [Git](https://git-scm.com/) as our version control manager. Install the [latest version](https://git-scm.com/downloads) in order to have version control for the project.

- open your command line tool and navigate to the directory you wish to install the project into and download the project using `git clone <project-repo-link>`

- download latest version of [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) as npm (node package manager) and node.js server language are used in the project.

- This project uses the javascript framework Angular. Install Angular CLI by running this command on the command line at the root of your project directory.

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running. Type all commands into the root of your project directory.

Install all project dependencies using npm.

```
npm install --save-dev @angular-devkit/build-angular
```

To run project locally use the command

```
npm start
```

The app will run locally on the url http://localhost:4200/

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
